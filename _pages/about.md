I am an Associate Professor at [National Center for Applied Mathematics](https://cqcam.cqnu.edu.cn/Version2022/sy.htm), [Chongqing Normal University](https://www.cqnu.edu.cn/). I obtained the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](http://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html) and supervised by professor [Zhenyu He](http://www.hezhenyu.cn). My current research interests mainly focus on the thermal infrared visual perception, including infrared object tracking and detection, infrared image processing, and image fusion.
