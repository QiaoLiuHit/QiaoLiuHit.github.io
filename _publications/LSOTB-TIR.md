In this paper, we present a Large-Scale and high-diversity general Thermal InfraRed (TIR) Object Tracking Benchmark, called LSOTBTIR, which consists of an evaluation dataset and a training dataset with a total of 1,400 TIR sequences and more than 600K frames. We annotate the bounding box of objects in every frame of all sequences and generate over 730K bounding boxes in total. To the best of our knowledge, LSOTB-TIR is the largest and most diverse TIR object tracking benchmark to date. To evaluate a tracker on different attributes, we define 4 scenario attributes and 12 challenge attributes in the evaluation dataset. By releasing LSOTB-TIR, we encourage the community to develop deep learning based TIR trackers and evaluate them fairly and comprehensively. We evaluate and analyze more than 30 trackers on LSOTB-TIR to provide a series of baselines, and the results show that deep trackers achieve promising performance. Furthermore, we re-train several representative deep trackers on LSOTB-TIR, and their results demonstrate that the proposed training dataset significantly improves the performance of deep TIR trackers.
